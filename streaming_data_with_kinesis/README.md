# Tutorial: Pushing Sensor Data to Cloud through AWS Kinesis

This tutorial demonstrates how to set up a **simple RTSP-based sensor streaming pipeline** in MSight and stream the data to the cloud using **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams**. This architecture is the **recommended approach for real-time sensor streaming with low end-to-end latency**, making it suitable for applications such as live perception, online analytics, and time-critical safety services.

In this setup, sensor data are ingested from RTSP sources at the edge, serialized by MSight, and pushed directly to AWS Kinesis for immediate downstream consumption. While this design provides near–real-time performance, it is important to note that continuous real-time streaming can be **costly at scale**. If your application does not require 100-millisecond-level latency and you are primarily focused on cost efficiency, consider using our **alternative example** that aggregates image data locally and uploads encoded video segments to the cloud for offline or near–real-time processing.
